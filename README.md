This is a node based editor for playing around with shaft loom drafts and woven patterns.

This is another experimental app in a family of apps I've created to explore the idea of a Loom Programming Environment.

There are source nodes and textile nodes. In the future there might be more intermediary nodes for breaking out steps of a shader, or for applying common effects across multiple source nodes.

Part of the reason I want to try this approach is to give _react flow_ a try, and because I had the idea of composing multiple woven textiles into layered objects, and the idea of node based editors (reusable components) would make that easier to realize and visualize.

## Installation

To install and run this node-based editor, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

	```bash
	git clone https://github.com/pcsteppan/weaving-by-nodes.git
	```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

	```bash
	cd weaving-by-nodes
	```

3. Install the dependencies:

	```bash
	npm install
	```

4. Start the development server:

	```bash
	npm run dev
	```

5. Open it in your browser

## Usage

Once the editor is running, you can start creating and manipulating nodes to design your shaft loom drafts and woven patterns. The editor provides a visual interface for connecting nodes and configuring their properties.
